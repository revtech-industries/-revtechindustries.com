Hero logo (revtech-logo.png) — for best look at top of page:

• Transparent background: Replace with a PNG that has no gray/white background (e.g. export from design tool with transparency, or use remove.bg).
• Sharp text: Use a high-resolution export (e.g. 2x the display size) so "RevTech Industries" and the tagline stay crisp.
• Banner format: Wide horizontal layout (ring + text) fits the hero strip best.

Current CSS sharpens scaling and adds a slight contrast boost; the file itself must be transparent and sharp for the best result.
